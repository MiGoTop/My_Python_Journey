# Chapter 12: Programming as a way of thinking

## 1. Variables and Types 
"variable" is a name that stores a value.
In Python we have different data types:
- 'int'  - integers, '3','-3'
- 'float' - Floating-points numbers, '3.14'
- 'str' - strings, '"hello"'
- 'bool' - Boolean values:'Trues' or 'False'
## 2. Arithmetic Operators
Python allows basic arithmetic operations:
Operators:  
- '-' - addition
- '*' - subtraction
- '/' - division(float)
- '//' - integer division
- '%' - reminder(modulus)
- '**' - exponentiation
- '+' - addition
## 3. Useful Arithmetic Functions
- abs(x) - returns the absolute value of a number 
- round(x,n) - rounds x to n decimal places
## 4. Summary 
- Learned about variables and data types 
- Applied arithmetic operators and expressions 
- Used basic Functions: abs,round
# Note
I will not include exercises for this topic 
The focus here is on understanding **variables, types, arithmetic operators, expressions, and basic functions**.  
I prefer to concentrate on more challenging exercises in the following chapters.
