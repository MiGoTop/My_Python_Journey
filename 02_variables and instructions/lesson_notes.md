# Chapter 2: Variables and Instructions

## 1. Assigning Values to Variables
- Variables store information that can be used later in a program.
- Assignment in Python uses the '=' operator:
```python
x = 5       # integer
name = "Alice"  # string
```
Variable names:
Can contain letters, numbers, and underscores _
Cannot start with a number
Cannot be a key word in Python
## 2. Importing Modules
A module is a file containing Python code, such as functions and variables, that can be reused.
Use 'import' to access a module
```python
import math
print(math.sqrt(16))   # 4.0
print(math.pi)         # 3.141592653589793
```
## 3. Input and Output
- **Input**: 'input()' reads data from the user as text (string).  
- **Output**: 'print()' displays values on the screen.
- By default, 'input()' returns a string, so convert to a number if needed
- 'print()' can display multiple values separated by commas

## 4. Summary
- Learned about functions and how to call them
- Practiced input and output with input() and print()
- Learned how to import modules and use their functions
- Explored the math module and its useful functions

# Note 
All exercises in the book are designed to help me **make mistakes** and then understand why something does not work.  
I complete **all exercises*** for practice, but on GitHub, I will only show exercises that I can fully describe and explain in Python.
